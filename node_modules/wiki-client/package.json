  "readme": "wiki-client\n===========\n\nFederated wiki client-side javascript as a npm module.\n\nGoals\n=====\n\nOver its first two years the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) project explored\nmany ways that a wiki could embrace HTML5 and related technologies. Here\nwe will cautiously reorganize this work as small independent modules that\nfavor ongoing innovation.\n\nWe proceed by dividing SFW first into large pieces and then these into\nsmaller pieces as we simplify and regularize the communications between them.\nWe now favor the node.js module and event conventions, dependency injection,\nand increased separation between the DOM and the logic that manages it.\n\nFederated wiki's single-page application reads page content from many sources\nand writes updates to a few. Read-write server backends are maintained in\nruby (sinatra) and node (express). Read-only servers have been realized\nwith static files and cgi scripts. Encouraging experiments have exploited\nexotic service architectures such as CCNx content-addressable networks.\n\nParticipation\n=============\n\nWe're happy to take issues or pull requests regarding the goals and\ntheir implementation within this code.\n\nA wider-ranging conversation is documented in the GitHub ReadMe of the\nfounding project, [SFW](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/blob/master/ReadMe.md).\n",
